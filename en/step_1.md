## Introduction

These are the Advanced Scratch Sushi Cards, and with them youâ€™ll make a platform-style game to which you can later add your own levels, powers, and characters!

### What you will make

Here is an example of the game you will build. Feel free to improve on my "art".

Use the arrow keys to move the cat around. Watch out for the dog!
